            It's happening on Saturday 18th of April 2020, from 10:00 in Leeds. The adventure starts in Leeds Town Hall. We're in the Broderick Suite so you need to come in the XXX Street entrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some important words, signing some documents, and maybe taking some pictures, the adventure moves to Leeds Industrial Museum. From 11:00, there will be a potluck lunch and a film or two on in the cinema. Our showings in the cinema will
            finish at 13:00
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll be able to explore the museum and the grounds as much as you want until 16:00.
          </p>
          <p class="app-margin-bottom--3">
            After that, anyone who wants to is welcome to come back to our house and have a few drinks.
          </p>

          <h2>Important to know</h2>
          <h3>What should you wear?</h3>
          <p class="app-margin-bottom--2">
            Something that you like and that's comfortable. We'll be dressed up but you don't have to if you don't want.
          </p>

          <h3>What food will there be?</h3>
          <p class="app-margin-bottom--2">
            We're ordering some of our favourite foods from around Leeds, but please bring something you'd like to eat if you can.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I bring someone?</h3>
          <p class="app-margin-bottom--2">
            You can totally bring someone that you like, and who's nice. Children are welcome, but there won't be many other children for them to play with.
          </p>

          <h3>How are we getting between the two places?</h3>
          <p>
            The places are about 3 miles apart at each stage, so we're probably going to get order some taxis on the day, but if you'd prefer the walk by the canal is nice and takes about an hour. A local bus also runs from by the Town Hall to near the
            Museum. A taxi will be about £6, or the bus is £4.50.
          </p>
          <p class="app-margin-bottom--3">
            There's free parking at the museum, and there are a few car parks near the Town Hall.
          </p>

          <h2>Sound like a good plan?</h2>
